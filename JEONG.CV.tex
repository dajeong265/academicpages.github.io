{\bf ``{Can the Party in Power Systematically Win a Majority in Close Legislative Elections? Evidence from U.S. State Assemblies}''} with Ajay Shenoy. \textit{Forthcoming} at \textit{Journal of Politics}%\hfill 2015\\
%We study whether ruling parties can systematically win a slender majority of seats in close legislative elections, a phenomenon called ``precise control.'' We test for discontinuities in two outcomes that, in the absence of precise control, should be smooth at the 50\% cutoff: the probability density of the share of seats won, and the identity of the party that previously held a majority. We find robust evidence of precise control, but only in high-stakes state elections that determine which party controls Congressional redistricting. Its absence in other elections suggests precise control is a strategic option used at the ruling party's discretion. It shifts its strategy in high-stakes elections from seat maximization to majority-seeking, winning fewer seats but reducing the chance it loses its majority. These tactics are disproportionately effective for the party defending a majority. It is 4 times more likely to win than to lose a close election.

%		Job search costs are high in rural labor markets in developing countries. Consequently, the flow of information on jobs and wages is limited, and wages tend to be dispersed. To lower search costs, I develop an SMS-based messaging app that connects agricultural workers and employers. The treatment reduces within-village wage dispersion by 16-40 percent. Wage compression occurs from both sides of the wage distribution, leaving the average wage unchanged. Consistent with reduced wage dispersion, I find evidence that labor is reallocated within villages. Dispersion in per-acre labor input across farms decreases. Workers divert job applications from lower-paying to higher-paying employers.

 %\hfill 2015\\ 
%We collect data on prices, travel costs and farmer decisions to quantify market access and its impact on agricultural productivity in 1,183 villages in two regions of Tanzania. Villages at the bottom of the travel cost-adjusted price distribution face 40-55\% less favorable input prices than those at the top. One standard deviation of remoteness is associated with 20-25\% lower input adoption and output sales. A spatial model of input adoption conservatively estimates that farmers behave as if travel costs are 5.7\% ad-valorem per kilometer. Counterfactual estimates suggest that halving travel costs would double adoption and reduce the gradient by 15\%.

{\bf ``{Is Corruption Compensation? Evidence from Local Public Office in India}''} with Ajay Shenoy and Laura Zimmermann. Reject \& Resubmit at \textit{Journal of Development Economics} %\hfill 2015\\
%The old idea that corruption ``greases the wheels'' of government has recently been revived to propose that local officials in developing countries will better implement welfare programs if improved performance also allows more corruption. We test this corruption-as-compensation hypothesis in Indian villages whose presidents, in charge of running a massive public works scheme, claim such behavior is widespread. We link millions of administrative
%job records to election outcomes, enabling us to measure both the presidents' performance and their self-dealing. Despite the seemingly ideal context, our results are more consistent with imperfect monitoring than corruption as compensation. In the year after the election, winners of close elections receive 3 times as many workdays as losers and typical villagers. But self-dealing declines over time in villages with plausibly better monitoring capacity, even
%though there is no decline in performance. In villages without such capacity, self-dealing persists.
